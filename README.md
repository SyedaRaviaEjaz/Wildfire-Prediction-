# Wildfire-Prediction-
The project aims to identify and predict the occurrence of wildfire given the dataset of satellite images of wildfire. A custom CNN model is used to make efficient image classification and transfer learning is applied using a pretrained model VGG16.

The model is trained for 5 eposchs only due to resource constraint and a better performance can be achieved by training on higher epoch values. 

The model is trained on google colab T4 GPU.
